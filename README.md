Multibular fixed bed catalytic reactor model for non-adiabatic water-gas shift reaction.
The model is composed by a set of differential equations, which represent the tube-side of a non-adiabatic catalytic reactor.
It is able to predict compostion, temperature and pressure along the reactor length. In addition, it calculates the power required to pressurize the gas mixture to the desired reactor inlet pressure and the heat exchanger area for cooling between compression stages.
The maim.m file returns the sum between the operational and capital cost for a 20-years operation horizon.
Non-ideal gas behavior is considered. For more information, see the process description at https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c03262
